# Existing self-type implementations review

Surprisingly, there is a lot of research around self-types in the academy and not so many implementations in industrial languages.

Things that we are interested at most are:
* Values of self-type: only receiver (`this`) has self-type or something else
* Permitted positions of self-types

## Academy

Self-type is in fact a type parameter of a recursive type bounded with mu-notation.
It can be safely used in covariant positions, but if self-type occurs in the contravariant position, then inheritors are not subtypes anymore ([[Inheritance is not subtyping, Cook at al., 1990]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/96709.96721)).
So a lot of academic efforts are directed to solve this misconception and to use safely self-types in contravariant positions preserving useful applications:
* Use *matching* relation instead of subtyping ([[Bruce et al., 1996]](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kim-Bruce-2/publication/221496196_Subtyping_Is_Not_a_Good_Match_for_Object-Oriented_Languages/links/09e415122545c6d7a4000000/Subtyping-Is-Not-a-Good-Match-for-Object-Oriented-Languages.pdf))
* Explicitly distinguish exact and existential types ([[Saito et al, 2009]](http://www.fos.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~igarashi/papers/pdf/thistype-SAC09.pdf))
* Named wildcards and exact type parameters ([[Na et al, 2012]](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sukyoung-Ryu/publication/254004584_Exact_type_parameterization_and_ThisType_support/links/54b90ed10cf269d8cbf72d01/Exact-type-parameterization-and-ThisType-support.pdf))

To be able to safely type some non-receiver values with self-type, scientific papers propose to introduce special kinds of methods:
* Nonheritable methods: ([[Saito et al, 2009]](http://www.fos.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~igarashi/papers/pdf/thistype-SAC09.pdf))
* Virtual constructors ([[Na et al, 2012]](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sukyoung-Ryu/publication/254004584_Exact_type_parameterization_and_ThisType_support/links/54b90ed10cf269d8cbf72d01/Exact-type-parameterization-and-ThisType-support.pdf))

## TypeScript

https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/classes.html#this-types

Implementation of self-types is not safe due to lack of restrictions on the contravariant positions:

```typescript
class Box {
  content: string = "";
  sameAs(other: this): boolean {
    return other.content === this.content;
  }
}

class DerivedBox extends Box {
  otherContent: string = "?";
  sameAs(other: this): boolean {
    if (other.otherContent === undefined) {
      console.log("TS type system is broken")
    }
    return other.otherContent === this.otherContent;
  }
}

const base = new Box();
const derived = new DerivedBox();

function test(x: Box): boolean {
  return x.sameAs(base)
}

test(derived) // prints: TS type system is broken
```

The only inhabitant of this-type is the receiver (`this`).

## Python

https://peps.python.org/pep-0673/

Self-type implementation strategy in Python is to convert them back to the `TypeVar` with recursive constraint.

The design of self-type in Python is similar to the TypeScript with no safety guarantees and receiver as the only inhabitant.

## Java Manifold

Java compiler plugin Manifold allows annotating a type with `@Self`:
https://github.com/manifold-systems/manifold/tree/master/manifold-deps-parent/manifold-ext\#the-self-type-with-self

```java
class VehicleBuilder {
    /* ... */
    public @Self VehicleBuilder withWheels(int wheels) {
        _wheels = wheels;
        return this;
    }
}

class AirplaneBuilder extends VehicleBuilder {
    /* ... */
}

 Airplane airplane = new AirplaneBuilder()
    .withWheels(2) // : AirplaneBuilder
    .withWings(1);
```

It is also possible to use `@Self` in the input position.
It provides some additional type restrictions:

```java
class A {
    public boolean equals(@Self Object obj) {
        /* ... */
    }
}

A a = new A();
a.equals("String instead of A"); // compilation error
```

However, such restrictions can be easily got around.
So canonical `isinstance` check in the `equals` method is still needed:

```java
Object obj = a;
obj.equals(String instead of A); // no compilation error
```

Other covariant positions of `@Self` are also allowed and contravariant ones still require runtime checks:

```java
public class Node {
    private List<Node> children;

    public List<@Self Node> getChildren() {
        return children;
    }

    public void addChild(@Self Node child) {
        checkAssignable(this, child); // Необходима проверка
        children.add(child);
    }
}

public class MyNode extends Node {
    /* ... */
}

MyNode myNode = findMyNode();
List<MyNode> = myNode.getChildren();
```

Manifold allows declaring extension functions in Java where `@Self` is an extension receiver type:

```java
public static <K,V> @Self Map<K,V> add(
        @This Map<K,V> thiz, K key, V value) {
    thiz.put(key, value);
    return thiz;
}

HashMap<String, String> map = new HashMap<>()
    .add("nick", "grouper")
    .add("miles", "amberjack");
```

## Swift

Self-type in classes can only be used in return positions, and the only inhabitant is a receiver (`self`).
Class that conforms a protocol with self-types in other positions should replace them by itself:

```swift
protocol P {
    func produce() -> Self
    func consume(_ x: Self)
}

class C: P {
    func produce() -> Self { return self }
    func consume(_ x: #\framebox{C}#) {}
}
```

When a protocol is used as type parameter bound, this type parameter replaces self-types on method invocation: 

```swift
func testConstrait<T: P>(_ x: T) {
    x.consume(/* value of type T is expected */)
}
```

Protocols can be bounds for existential types.
In that case, method call with self-type non-return positions is prohibited:

```swift
func testAny(_ x: any P) {
    // error: member 'consume' cannot be used on value of type
    // 'any P'; consider using a generic constraint instead
    x.consume(/* ... */)
}
```
