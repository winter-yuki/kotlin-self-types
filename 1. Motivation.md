# Self-type motivation

Self-types can be emulated with weird boilerplate code using recursive generics and/or some additional casts. 
However, they are needed in some useful patterns, so there can be a reason to make them a language feature. 
Moreover, self-type bypasses are enough cumbersome to make programmer choose less suitable design choices in some cases.

## Transformation chains

The most common example of self-types application is an [abstract builder pattern](https://medium.com/@hazraarka072/fluent-builder-and-powering-it-up-with-recursive-generics-in-java-483005a85fcd). 
Nevertheless, in Kotlin builders are usually implemented via extension receivers or `apply` function (a builder object should be mutable here). 
Although, if we want to construct a transformation chain of an immutable object (or to use *prototype* architecture pattern with `clone()` method in class hierarchy), self-types are still useful.

### Persistent collections

Modification methods of a persistent data structure do not modify a collection itself but create a modified new one.

To modify such collections in fluent style using methods of the base classes, [recursive generics](http://web.archive.org/web/20130721224442/http:/passion.forco.de/content/emulating-self-types-using-java-generics-simplify-fluent-api-implementation) can be used:

```kotlin
interface PCollection<out E, out S : PCollection<E, S>> {
    fun add(value: @UnsafeVariance E): S
}

interface PList<out E, out S : PList<E, S>> : PCollection<E, S> {
    fun listSpecific()
}

class PListImpl<out E> : PList<E, PListImpl<E>> {
    /* ... */
}

fun <T, L : PList<T, L>> test(xs: L, x: T) {
    xs.add(x) /* : L */ .listSpecific()
}
```

The disadvantages of this approach are:
* Recursive generics infect all the code that uses them
* Explicit type cast is needed: `this as Self`
* Type parameter `S` being once specified cannot be revised lower in an inheritance hierarchy
* Recursive generics pattern is cumbersome and not trivial to understand

Alternatively, derived class can declare overrides ([kotlinx.immutable](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.collections.immutable/blob/d7b83a13fed459c032dab1b4665eda20a04c740f/core/commonMain/src/ImmutableList.kt#L66)) for all modification methods with more specific return types:
* A lot of boilerplate code: overrides for each method for each inherited class
* There is no compiler control ensuring that such overrides were not forgotten, so a developer can easily add new methods in the base class and forget to add overrides to all derived classes
* Works only for return types

There is another language feature that is similar to recursive generics but requires less boilerplate code - *associated types (abstract type members)*.
It is available in Scala for example.

```scala
trait PCollection[T] {
  type S
  def add(x: T): S
}

trait PList[T] extends PCollection[T] {
  type S <: PList[T]
  def listSpecific: Unit
}

class PListImpl[T] extends PList[T] {
  type S = PListImpl[T]
  override def add(x: T): PListImpl[T] = ???
  override def listSpecific: Unit = ???
}
```

Disadvantages:
* Every inheritor should revise a bound of an associated type
* Associated type definition should be provided in the first non-abstract class and cannot be revised in inheritors
* Implementation and usage of associated types are non-trivial ([path-dependent types](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2714064.2660216))

Having a self-type feature, code does not have the aforementioned issues:

```kotlin
interface PCollection<out E> {
    fun add(value: @UnsafeVariance E): Self
}

interface PList<out E> : PCollection<E> {
    fun listSpecific()
}

class PListImpl<out E> : PList<E> {
    /* ... */
}

fun <T> test(xs: PList<T>, x: T) {
    xs.add(x) /* : PList<T> */ .listSpecific()
}
```

### Immutable data structures

It is also useful to be able to create instances in the base class, e.g. to provide default implementation (example from [YouTrack](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-6494)):

```kotlin
sealed interface Data {
    data class One(val a: Int) : Data
    data class Two(val a: Int, val b: Int) : Data

    fun update(a: Int): Self = 
        when (this) {
            is One -> One(a)
            is Two -> Two(a, b)
        }
}

fun test() {
    val a = Data.One(1)
    val b: Data.One = a.update(42)
}
```

`Self` is also able to reduce boilerplate on a duplicating receiver type in the return position of function declaration. 
It seems more convenient than not to write a return type when a function actually returns something ([copy fun](https://github.com/Kotlin/KEEP/blob/master/notes/value-classes.md#abstracting-updates-into-functions)).

## Observer pattern

```kotlin
abstract class AbstractObservable {
    private val observers = mutableListOf<(Self) -> Unit>()

    fun observe(observer: (Self) -> Unit) {
        observers += observer
    }

    private fun notifyObservers() {
        observers.forEach { observer ->
            observer(this)
        }
    }

    protected fun <V> observable(initialValue: V) =
        object : ObservableProperty<V>(initialValue) {
            override fun afterChange(property: KProperty<*>, oldValue: V, newValue: V) {
                notifyObservers()
            }
        }
}

enum class Color {
    Purple, Blue
}

class Entity : AbstractObservable() {
    var color: Color by observable(Color.Purple)
}

fun observer(entity: Entity) {
    println("New color = ${entity.color}")
}

fun main() {
    val entity = Entity().apply {
        observe(::observer)
    }
    entity.color = Color.Blue // Observer prints new color here
}
```

## Abstract factory pattern

```kotlin
abstract class Element<out F : Factory>(val factory: F)

interface Factory {
    fun create(): Element<Self>
}

abstract class SpecificFactory : Factory {
    abstract fun doSpecific()
}

fun <F : SpecificFactory> test(element: Element<F>) {
    entity.factory.doSpecific()
}
```

## Recursive data structures

https://micsymposium.org/mics_2009_proceedings/mics2009_submission_56.pdf

```kotlin
abstract class Node<out T>(
    val value: T, val children: List<Self>
)

class BetterNode<out T>(
    value: T, children: List<Self> = emptyList()
) : Node<T>(value, children) {
    fun betterSpecific() = println(value)
}

fun test() {
    val betterTree = BetterNode(value = 2, children =
        listOf<BetterNode<Int>>(
            BetterNode(1, listOf(BetterNode(0))),
            BetterNode(4, listOf(BetterNode(3), BetterNode(5)))))
    betterTree.children
        .flatMap { it.children }
        .forEach { it.betterSpecific() } // Печатает "0 3 5"
}
```

## Algebras

Another classical application of self-type is encoding of the algebraic structures.
So semigroup interface could be denoted in the following way:

```kotlin
interface Semigroup {
    infix fun add(other: Self): Self
}
```

However, there is no way to denote zero-arity functional symbols because every method has at least one argument (`this`).

In modern Kotlin, there is already a mechanism that suits better for describing algebras: context receivers.

```kotlin
interface Semigroup<S> {
    infix fun S.add(other: S): S
}

interface Monoid<M> : Semigroup<M> {
    val empty: M
}

object StringMonoid : Monoid<String> {
    override val empty: String = ""
    override fun String.add(other: String): String = this + other
}

context(Monoid<T>)
fun <T> concat(vararg xs: T): T =
    xs.fold(empty) { acc, x -> acc add a }

fun test() {
    with(StringMonoid) {
        println(concat("a", "bc", "d")) // Печатает "abcd"
    }
}
```
